        <div id="bio">
            <p>My name is Alexander Booth. I was born in Orlando, Florida but have lived in Clermont, Florida
                my whole life. I live in a Lake House on the Clermont Chain of Lakes. I love to take my boat out with
                friends ansd wakesurf. Sometimes we even take the golf cart out in the trails which is fun too. I decided to get into web development is because i always have been the tech go to in my family and wanted to learn coding as a way to further my tech knowledge. I also have always wanted the idea of having a job that doesnt tie me to one location with an in office posistion as well as the fact i can freelance and work on my own ventures with my knowledge.</p>
            <p>I am the middle child in a family of 5. My mom and dad got married 24 years ago in San Fransisco. My dad
                is from the UK and most recentley retired seling timeshare for West Gate. My mom is currently the Senior
                Vice President of Holiday Inn Club Vacations. My older brother lives in Miami as a wakeboard coach and boat captain. My little sister is a USA gymnastics natonal team member and lives at home with me and my parents. Plus a little australlian shepherd named Hali.</p>
